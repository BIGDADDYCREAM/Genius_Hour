        <p class="txt"> What is coding? Coding is when you give a computer a set of instructions it has to carry out.
            <br> 
            There are many different types of coding. There is HTML, CSS, Javascript, the one we'll be using called Python and many more.
            <br>
             The reason you should start with Python is because it has a very easy syntax. It almost sounds like a human talking. 
             <br>
             Python is generaly used to make make charts or graphs. But there is many other uses for it. You can also use it to make games and almost anything you want.
             <br>
             The only reason Python is a tad inconvinient is that you have to download it, unlike Javascript, HTML and CSS which uses the web. But don't worry about this too much, Python is very easy to install. 
            <br>
            The hardest thing to do is probably to choose your Python editor. There is so many options. Personally I like Visual Studio code, but I'm sure there are a bunch of other great editors for it like, Tynker which is online so you don't have to download Python, Jupyter Notebook which is to be installed and of course you can use the built in not too advanced TextEdit for Mac, Notepad for Windows, Text for Chromebook and Nano and Vim for linux.
